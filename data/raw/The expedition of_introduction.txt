INTRODUCTION. 


The  blood-stained  cruise  of  the  “ tyrant  Aguirre/5 
the  translated  narrative  of  which,  from  the  text  of 
the  old  chronicler  Simon,  is  now  printed  for  the 
first  time,  is  by  far  the  most  extraordinary  ad- 
venture in  search  of  El  Dorado  on  record.  The 
dauntless  hardihood  of  those  old  Spaniards  and  Ger- 
mans, who,  undismayed  by  the  reverses  and  sufferings 
of  numerous  predecessors,  continued  to  force  their  way 
for  hundreds  of  miles  into  the  forest  covered  wilds,  is 
sufficiently  astonishing;  but  in  this  cruise  of  Aguirre 
all  that  is  wildest,  most  romantic,  most  desperate, 
most  appalling  in  the  annals  of  Spanish  enterprise 
seems  to  culminate  in  one  wild  orgie  of  madness  and 
blood. 

The  history  of  previous  searches  after  the  fabled 
El  Dorado,  which  led  to  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and 
Aguirre,  truthful  and  authentic  as  it  is,  yet  seems 
fitter  for  the  pages  of  King  Arthur’s  romance  than 
for  a sober  narrative  of  facts.  It  is  necessary,  how- 
ever, that  these  romantic  expeditions  should  be  fresh 
in  the  reader’s  mind,  in  order  to  understand  the 
objects  and  views  of  the  men  who  followed  Aguirre

to  destruction,  and  the  exact  position  which  his 
expedition  occupies  in  the  history  of  South  American 
geographical  discovery. 

When  the  Spaniards  had  conquered  and  pillaged 
the  civilized  empires  on  the  table  lands  of  Mexico, 
Bogota,  and  Peru,  they  began  to  look  round  for  new 
scenes  of  conquest,  new  sources  of  wealth ; the 
wildest  rumours  were  received  as  facts,  and  the 
forests  and  savannas,  extending  for  thousands  of 
square  miles  to  the  eastward  of  the  cordilleras  of  the 
Andes,  were  covered,  in  imagination,  with  populous 
kingdoms,  and  cities  filled  with  gold.  The  story  of 
El  Dorado,  of  a priest  or  king  smeared  with  oil  and 
then  coated  with  gold  dust,  probably  originated  in  a 
custom  which  prevailed  amongst  the  civilized  Indians 
of  the  plateau  of  Bogota;1  but  El  Dorado  was  placed, 

1 “ When  the  chief  of  Guatavita  was  independent,  he  made  a 
solemn  sacrifice  every  year,  which,  for  its  singularity,  contributed 
to  give  celebrity  to  the  lake  of  Guatavita,  in  the  most  distant  coun- 
tries, and  which  was  the  origin  of  the  belief  in  El  Dorado,  in 
search  of  which  so  many  years  and  so  much  wealth  was  employed. 
On  the  day  appointed  the  chief  smeared  his  body  with  turpentine, 
and  then  rolled  in  gold  dust.  Thus  gilded  and  resplendent,  he 
entered  the  canoe,  surrounded  by  his  nobles,  whilst  an  immense 
multitude  of  people,  with  music  and  songs,  crowded  round  the 
shores  of  the  lake.  Having  reached  the  centre,  the  chief  deposited 
his  offerings  of  gold,  emeralds,  and  other  precious  things,  and  then 
jumped  in  himself,  to  bathe.  At  this  moment  the  surrounding 
hills  echoed  with  the  applause  of  the  people ; and,  when  the  reli- 
gious ceremony  concluded,  the  dancing,  singing,  and  drinking 
began.” — Descubrimiento  de  la  Nuevei  Granada , por  el  Coronel  J. 
Acosta,  p.  199.

by  the  credulous  adventurers,  in  a golden  city  amidst 
the  impenetrable  forests  of  the  centre  of  South 
America,  and,  as  search  after  search  failed,  his 
position  was  moved  further  and  further  to  the  east- 
ward, in  the  direction  of  Guiana.  El  Dorado,  the 
phantom  god  of  gold  and  silver,  appeared  in  many 
forms.  The  Spaniards  of  Bogota  and  Venezuela 
explored  the  head  waters  of  the  Orinoco  and  the  Bio 
Negro  in  search  of  the  66  gilded  man,”  or  the  golden 
“ house  of  the  sun,”  and  no  fabulous  tale  was  too 
wild  for  their  credulity.  The  settlers  at  Quito  and 
in  Northern  Peru  talked  of  the  golden  empire  of  the 
Omaguas,  while  those  in  Cuzco  and  Charcas  dreamt 
of  the  wealthy  cities  of  Paytiti  and  Enim,  on  the 
banks  of  a lake  far  away  to  the  eastward  of  the 
Andes.  These  romantic  fables,  so  firmly  believed  in 
those  old  days,  led  to  the  exploration  of  vast  tracts  of 
country,  by  the  fearless  adventurers  of  the  sixteenth 

of  Parima,  and  golden  city  of  Manoa.  It  is  implied  that  the 
ceremony  did  not  take  place  subsequent  to  the  conquest  of  Gua- 
tavita  by  Nemequene,  the  Zipa  of  Bogota,  about  forty  years  before 
the  appearance  of  the  Spaniards  ; so  that,  on  their  arrival,  tradi- 
tions only  existed  of  the  gilded  chief  of  the  lake,  which,  in  a con- 
fused and  exaggerated  form,  seem  to  have  originated  the  belief 
in  El  Dorado,  and  in  a great  city  in  the  central  plains  of  South 
America. 

The  people  of  Guatavita  believed  that  their  deity  resided  in  the 
lake,  and  yearly  sacrifices  of  gold  and  emeralds  were  made  to  him. 
Cochrane  gives  an  amusing  account  of  an  attempt  to  drain  this  lake, 
which  is  only  a short  distance  from  Bogota ; and  several  gold 
ornaments  have  been  fished  up,  from  time  to  time,  but  it  is  be- 
lieved that  millions  still  remain  buried  in  the  slime,  at  the  bottom.

century,  portions  of  which  have  never  been  traversed 
since,  even  to  this  day. 

The  most  famous  searches  after  El  Dorado  were 
undertaken  from  the  coast  of  Venezuela,  and  the 
most  daring  leaders  of  these  wild  adventures  were 
German  Knights.1 

Shortly  after  Ojeda  had  discovered  the  coast  of 
Venezuela,  and  Rodrigo  de  Bastidas  had  established 
a settlement  at  Santa  Martha,  the  emperor  Charles  V 
made  an  agreement  with  a company  of  Germans  to 
colonize  these  rich  provinces.  The  Velsers  of  Augs- 
burg were  great  merchants  who  traded  in  all  parts  of 
the  world,  and  they  agreed,  through  their  Agents, 
Enrique  de  Alfinger  and  Geronimo  Sailler,  to  found 
two  cities  and  three  forts  within  two  years,  to  arm 
four  ships,  and  take  out  three  hundred  Spaniards 
and  fifty  German  miners ; on  condition  that  the 
emperor  granted  them  the  country  extending  from 
Cabo  de  la  Vela  to  Maracapana  (except  the  portion 
previously  granted  to  one  Juan  de  Ampuez)  and 
without  limit  to  the  south,  gave  the  title  of  Adelan- 
tado  to  the  governor  appointed  by  them,  and  allowed 
them  to  make  slaves  of  the  Indians.2  At  about  the 
same  time  Bastidas,  the  governor  of  Santa  Martha, 
had  died,  and  it  was  arranged  that  Garcia  de  Lerma,

and  Geronimo  de  Ortal,  the  lying  tale  of  Martinez  concerning  the 
city  of  Manoa,  the  advance  of  Sedeho  towards  the  Meta,  and  the 
remarkable  expedition  of  Berreo,  have  already  been  described  in 
Sir  Robert  Schomburgk’s  copious  notes  to  Raleigh’s  Guiana.

a knight  of  Burgos,  the  new  governor,  should  go  out 
in  the  German  ships  to  Santa  Martha,  and  that  the 
Germans  should  then  proceed  to  their  destination. 
Ambrosio  de  Alfinger  was  named  governor,  and 
Bartolome  Sailler  Lieutenant  Governor,  by  the  Vel- 
sers,  both  Germans,  and  the  expedition  sailed  from 
Spain  in  1528. 

Having  landed  Lerma  at  Santa  Martha,  Ambrosio 
de  Alfinger,  with  four  hundred  men  and  fifty  horses, 
went  to  Coro,  on  the  coast  of  Venezuela,  which  had 
been  founded  in  1527  by  Juan  de  Ampuez,  who 
afterwards  retired  to  Curacoa.  The  coast  offered  few 
temptations  to  the  German  adventurer,  and  Alfinger, 
leaving  his  lieutenant  Sailler  in  command  at  Coro, 
determined  to  make  an  expedition  into  the  interior, 
in  1530,  in  search  of  some  fabulous  golden  city  in  the 
forests  far  to  the  south.  He  left  Coro  with  about 
two  hundred  Spaniards,  and  several  hundred  un- 
fortunate Indians,  laden  with  provisions  and  stores  ; 
and  the  cruelties,  committed  by  this  savage  on  the 
poor  defenceless  people,  were  reported  in  Europe,  and 
were  amongst  the  tales  which  made  the  blood  of 

Raleigh  and  Sir  Richard  Hawkins  boil  with  generous 

% 

indignation  at  the  very  name  of  a Spaniard.  To 
prevent  the  laden  Indians  from  deserting,  Alfin- 
ger’s  soldiers  fastened  them  to  a chain,  by  a ring 
round  their  necks ; thus,  to  let  one  out,  it  was 
necessary  to  loosen  the  whole  row ; but,  to  save 
time,  when  an  Indian  became  too  tired  to  go  on, 
they  cut  off*  his  head,  and  let  the  body  drop  out, 
saying  that,  as  it  was  necessary  to  leave  him  behind,

INTRODUCTION. 


it  was  the  same  to  them  whether  he  was  alive  or 
dead,  and  the  trouble  of  loosening  the  chain  was 
saved. 

When  Alfinger  reached  the  lagoon  which  the  river 
Cesar  forms,  at  its  confluence  with  the  Magdalena, 
the  fame  of  his  cruelties  had  preceded  him,  and  all 
the  natives  had  taken  refuge  on  the  islands  in  the 
lake ; but  the  greedy  Spaniards,  seeing  the  glitter  of 
their  golden  ornaments  from  a distance,  spurred  their 
horses  into  the  lake,  and  swam  to  one  of  the  islands, 
where  the  Indians,  terrified  at  so  strange  a sight, 
were  all  killed  or  taken  prisoners.  The  Indian  chief 
of  the  district  of  Tamalameque  gave  himself  up,  and 
supplied  the  Spaniards  with  provisions  and  gold 
ornaments.  So  great  was  the  spoil,  that  Alfinger 
sent  twenty-five  of  his  men  back  to  Coro,  with  booty 
valued  at  60,000  dollars,  to  buy  horses  and  arms  ; 
and  waited  a whole  year  for  their  return,  at  the 
confluence  of  the  rivers  Cesar  and  Margarita.  He 
waited  in  vain,  and  at  length  the  ruthless  adventurers 
began  to  follow  the  stream  of  the  Magdalena,  living 
on  wild  fruits  and  insects,  and  suffering  from  fever, 
and  the  torments  of  mosquitos  Their  wretchedness 
soon  became  unbearable,  and  Alfinger  led  them  up 
the  mountains  to  the  eastward,  into  a cold  country, 
where  they  lived  on  land  shells,  and  where  three 
hundred  of  the  naked  Indians  and  many  Spaniards 
were  frozen  to  death  during  the  nights.  The  wan- 
derers then  descended  into  the  valley  of  Chinacota, 
where  they  were  exposed  to  constant  attacks  from 
the  wild  Indians,  and  finally  Alfinger  was  wounded

in  the  neck,  and  died  in  three  days.  He  was  buried 
at  the  foot  of  a tree,  and  his  epitaph  was  cut  in  the 
bark,  by  his  surviving  comrades.1 

His  worn  out  followers  reached  the  valley  of 
Cucuta,  but,  rendered  fiercer  and  more  cruel  by  their 
sufferings,  they  slaughtered  men,  women,  and  chil- 
dren in  the  villages  on  their  line  of  march ; and,  in 
1532,  worn  out  and  decimated  by  disease,  they  found 
their  way  back  to  Coro  ; and  thus  ended  the  first 
expedition  of  the  Germans  in  Venezuela,  and  the 
first  search  for  El  Dorado.2 

On  the  death  of  Alfinger,  a German  knight  named 
Nicholas  Fedreman  went  to  Castille,  to  apply  for  the 
government  of  Venezuela ; but  it  was  given  to 
another  knight  of  the  same  nation,  named  George  of 
Spires,  and  Fedreman  was  appointed  his  lieutenant- 
general.  They  raised  four  hundred  men  in  Anda- 
lusia and  Murcia,  and  reached  Coro  in  1534.  Since 
the  time  of  Alfinger,  the  rumours  concerning  great 
wealth  to  be  found  in  the  wilds,  to  the  eastward  of 
the  Andes,  had  increased  in  number ; and  George  of 
Spires  resolved  to  make  an  attempt  to  solve  the  mys- 
tery which  enveloped  those  unknown  regions.3  He 
left  Coro  with  three  hundred  infantry  and  one  hun- 
dred cavalry,  crossed  the  mountains  near  the  sources 
of  the  Tocuyo,  descended  to  the  plains,  and,  after

2 Strictly  speaking,  Alfinger  did  not  search  for  El  Dorado,  as 
that  fable  was  not  yet  in  existence,  but  for  some  golden  country  of 
his  own  imagination.

waiting  for  some  months  until  the  periodical  in- 
undations of  those  regions  had  subsided,  began  his 
march  to  the  south.  The  expedition  of  George  of 
Spires,  which  commenced  in  1536,  was  composed  of 
determined  men  ; and  they  penetrated  into  regions 
which  have  scarcely  ever  been  visited  since,  braving 
hardships  and  dangers  which  would  have  been  in- 
surmountable to  men,  who  were  not  actuated  by 
the  extraordinary  enthusiasm  of  these  early  con- 
querors. They  avoided  the  mountains,  on  account 
of  the  great  difficulty  of  making  roads  passable  for 
horses  ; but,  in  doing  this,  they  encountered  great 
risks  in  crossing  the  rivers,  and  suffered  from  want 
of  provisions,  the  swarms  of  mosquitos,  the  unhealthi- 
ness of  the  climate,  and  the  attacks  of  wild  Indians. 
During  the  dry  season  they  found  plenty  of  deer  on 
the  plains,  which  supplied  them  with  wholesome 
food,  but,  when  the  rains  came  on,  and  the  country 
was  inundated,  their  sole  food  consisted  of  palmitos 
and  wild  roots  : and  the  attempts  they  made  to  con- 
struct canoes,  and  go  afloat  in  them,  in  search  of 
provisions,  only  ended  in  disappointment.  It  is  also 
recorded,  that  the  jaguars  were  so  numerous  and 
ferocious,  that  they  carried  off  the  horses  in  broad 
daylight,  and  even  killed  a Spaniard,  and  several 
Indians. 

George  continued  to  advance  to  the  south,  through 
a country  inhabited  by  different  Indian  tribes,  and 
found  great  inconvenience  from  the  diversity  of  lan- 
guages, which  rendered  interpreters  useless.  They 
crossed  the  Ariari,  and  afterwards  the  Guaviare  river, 


INTRODUCTION,

where  they  encountered  a tribe  of  Indians  called 
Guayupes,1  who  painted  their  bodies  black,  and  came 
to  battle  half  drunk,  so  that  it  was  not  difficult  to 
repulse  their  attacks.  The  extreme  point  reached 
by  the  knight  of  Spires  was  the  margin  of  the  river 
Papamene,2  whence  he  returned  to  Coro,  and  a glance 
at  the  map  will  show  the  immense  extent  of  country 
which  he  traversed,  in  this  daring  and  romantic  ex- 
pedition. During  the  retreat  to  Coro,  many  officers 
died,  and  among  them  Murcia  de  Fondon,  who  had 
acted  as  secretary  to  Francis  I,  during  his  captivity 
in  Madrid.  George  of  Spires  reached  Coro  in  May 
1538,  after  an  absence  of  three  years,  during  which 
time  he  marched  upwards  of  one  thousand  five  hun- 
dred miles  into  the  interior  of  South  America.  He 
was  a mild  good  man,  and  died  peacefully  as  gover- 
nor of  Venezuela,  in  1540.3 

In  the  meanwhile  his  lieutenant,  Nicholas  Fedre- 
man,  followed  his  chief,  with  reinforcements  and 
supplies,  until  he  found  himself  in  the  vicinity  of  his 
countryman’s  camp,  when  ambition  prompted  him  to 
avoid  a meeting,  and  to  continue  his  discoveries  on 

1 The  tJaupes  Indians,  on  the  head  waters  of  the  Rio  Negro,  of 
whom  a very  interesting  account  is  given  by  Wallace,  p.  482. 

2 The  same  as  the  river  Caqueta,  or  its  tributary  the  Rio  de  la 
Fragua,  according  to  Humboldt ; but  Colonel  Acosta,  in  his  map, 
makes  the  river  Papamene  one  of  the  tributaries  of  the  Guaviare. 

3 Benzoni,  however,  says  that  he  was  murdered  in  his  bed,  by 
the  Spaniards,  who  mangled  him,  by  dragging  his  body  igno- 
miniously  about,  and  finally  throwing  it  into  a wood.  He  adds 
that  the  murderers  were  severely  punished,  by  order  of  the  em- 
peror. ( Benzoni , in  Hakluyt  Coll.,  p.  76.)

his  own  account,  with  about  two  hundred  men. 
Fedreman  is  described  as  an  active  and  energetic 
German,  of  middle  size,  with  a flowing  red  beard ; 
he  was  beloved  by  his  soldiers,  and  no  cruelty  to  the 
Indians  is  recorded  of  him.  After  leaving  the 
track  of  his  chief,  Fedreman  came  to  the  banks  of  a 
river,  where  there  were  ruins  of  villages,  and  the 
Indians  told  him  that,  many  years  ago,  a serpent 
with  numerous  heads  had  come  out  of  the  river,  and 
devoured  all  the  inhabitants.  He  passed  the  rainy 
season  at  the  foot  of  the  mountains,  near  the  banks 
of  the  river  Casanare,  then  crossed  the  Meta,  and, 
after  wandering  about  for  three  years,  he  finally 
crossed  the  most  difficult  part  of  the  cordilleras  of 
Sumapaz,  and  met  the  famous  conquerors,  Quesada 
and  Belalcazar,  on  the  plains  of  Bogota,  in  April  1539. 

This  was,  in  many  respects,  a very  remarkable 
meeting.  The  great  conqueror  of  New  Granada, 
Don  Gonzalo  Ximenes  de  Quesada,  and  his  colleague, 
the  Adelantado  Pedro  Fernandez  de  Lugo,  in  ex- 
ploring the  course  of  the  river  Magdalena,  had  dis- 
covered the  country  of  the  civilized  Chibchas,  and 
reached  the  plateau  of  Bogota  in  1537.  The  history 
of  the  conquest  of  New  Granada,  which  is  equal  in 
interest  to  those  of  Mexico  or  Peru,  has  not  yet 
found  a Prescott ; although  the  Chibchas  were  more 
civilized  than  the  Aztecs,  prodigious  wealth  was 
derived  from  the  sack  of  their  cities,1  and  the  ad- 

1 At  Tunja  alone  the  Spaniards  found  191,294  dollars  worth  of 
fine  gold  ; 37,288  dollars  of  rough  gold  ; 18,390  dollars  of  silver  ; 
and  1815  emeralds.

ventures  of  the  Quesadas  were  as  romantic  as  those 
of  Cortes  or  Pizarro. 

Sebastian  de  Belalcazar  had  marched  north  from 
Quito,  conquered  Popayan  in  1535,  and  reached 
Bogota  in  1538  ; while  Fedreman,  after  wandering 
for  three  years  in  search  of  El  Dorado,  also  joined 
Quesada  and  Belalcazar,  on  the  heights  of  Bogota,  in 
1539.  After  a brief  sojourn,  the  three  discoverers 
proceeded  down  the  river  Magdalena  together  ; Lugo 
died  at  Santa  Martha,  while  Quesada  proceeded  to 
Spain,  to  obtain  the  government  of  his  new  dis- 
coveries, where  he  found  a formidable  rival  in  Luis, 
the  son  of  Pedro  Fernandez  de  Lugo. 

Hernan  Perez  de  Quesada,  the  brother  of  the 
great  discoverer,  was  left  in  command  at  Bogota,  and, 
excited  by  the  narrative  of  Fedreman’s  adventures, 
he  also  became  wild  for  the  discovery  of  El  Dorado. 
A party,  led  by  Montalvo  de  Lugo,  had  arrived  from 
Venezuela  in  the  footsteps  of  Fedreman,  and  Quesada 
joined  this  small  force  with  about  two  hundred  men 
and  some  horses,  and  set  out  in  search  of  “ the  house 
of  the  sun.”  Before  departing  from  Bogota,  how- 
ever, he  was  guilty  of  the  cowardly  and  unnecessary 
murder  of  the  young  Zaque  of  the  Chibchas,  in  order, 
as  he  said,  that  he  might  leave  the  affairs  of  Bogota 
in  a state  of  tranquillity  in  his  rear.1  Quesada 

1 This  Quesada  was  a brutal  adventurer.  He  not  only  mur- 
dered the  innocent  young  Quemichua,  Zaque  of  Bogota,  on  this 
occasion,  who  was  much  loved  by  the  Indians ; but  also  the  chiefs 
of  Samaca,  Turmeque,  Boyaca,  and  others,  as  he  said,  to  preserve 
tranquillity  in  his  rear.  It  was  believed  that  his  death  by  lightning 
some  years  afterwards,  was  a divine  visitation  for  this  cruelty.

appears  to  have  marched  from  Tunja,  and  to  have 
descended  into  the  plains,  taking  the  same  route  as 
George  of  Spires,  until  he  reached  the  forests  of 
Mocoa.  His  people  endured  the  most  appalling 
hardships,  and,  having  eaten  all  the  horses,  they 
were  finally  reduced  to  feed  upon  an  unhappy  old 
donkey  belonging  to  Friar  Fequejada,  their  father 
confessor,  which,  as  the  chronicler  pathetically  relates, 
“ was  brought  from  the  hills  of  Santa  Martha,  to 
leave  its  bones  amongst  the  affluents  of  the  Ama- 
zons.” At  length  Quesada  gave  up  all  hopes  of 
finding  “ the  house  of  the  sun,”  and,  having  lost  one 
half  of  his  men,  he  returned  to  Bogota,  after  an 
absence  of  one  year.1  He  was  the  first  to  enter  the 
land  of  the  Musos  Indians. 

While  Quesada  was  penetrating  into  the  central 
plains,  from  the  side  of  Bogota,  a large  and  important 
expedition  in  search  of  El  Dorado  was  organized  in 
Venezuela.  Soon  after  the  death  of  George  of  Spires 
in  1540,  the  Bishop,  Don  Bodrigo  Bastidas,2  became 
governor  of  Venezuela,  and  appointed  a German 
knight  named  Philip  von  Huten  to  be  his  Lieutenant 
General. 

Huten3  was  a relation  of  the  Velsers,  and  had  been 

1 Some  chroniclers  state  that  Quesada  descended  a second  time 
into  the  plains,  in  search  of  El  Dorado.  He  governed  Bogota  for

one  of  the  companions  of  George  of  Spires  in  his 
famous  expedition.  He  was  prudent  and  brave,  and 
no  captain  in  the  Indies  is  said  to  have  been  more 
humane.  In  July  1541  this  officer  organized  a great 
expedition  to  search  for  El  Dorado,  in  the  hope  of 
meeting  with  more  success  than  had  fallen  to  the  lot  of 
his  old  commander,  George  of  Spires.  Many  gallant 
young  cavaliers  flocked  to  his  standard ; Pedro  de 
Limpias  was  his  maestro  del  campo ; Bartolome 
Yelser,  a youth  of  great  promise,  Sebastian  de 
Amengua,  and  Pedro  de  Artiaga  were  his  captains. 
The  expedition  left  Coro  by  sea,  landed  at  Burburata, 
marched  thence  to  Barquisimeto,  and,  advancing  into 
the  central  plains,  wintered  at  a village  called  by 
George  of  Spires,  of  our  Lady,  and  by  Fedreman, 
La  Fragua,  where  he  received  tidings  that  Quesada, 
with  200  men,  had  passed,  a short  time  before  him. 
After  the  winter,  Huten  reached  the  province  of 
Papamene,1  near  the  skirts  of  the  cordilleras  of 
Timana,  where  an  Indian  advised  him  not  to  follow 
Quesada,  as  he  must  have  entered  an  uninhabited 
region,  and  suffered  severely.  The  Indian  offered  to 
conduct  Huten  to  a land  rich  in  gold  and  silver, 
to  a city  called  Macatoa,  on  the  banks  of  the  river 
Guaviare ; and  he  showed  him  some  apples  made  of 
gold  and  silver,  which  he  said  his  brother  had  brought 
from  that  city.  But  the  tales  of  this  Indian  were 
not  sufficient  to  induce  the  German  knight  to 
desist  from  following  on  the  track  of  Quesada, 

1 In  the  neighbourhood  of  the  head  waters  of  the  river  Caqueta 
or  Japura.

and,  after  marching  for  eight  days,  the  Indian  guide 
escaped. 

Sickness  and  famine  now  began  to  press  hard  upon 
the  intrepid  explorers.  Their  hunger  was  appeased 
by  placing  the  heads  of  maize  corn  at  the  mouths  of 
ant’s  nests,  which  were  soon  covered  with  ants,  and 
this,  for  many  days,  was  their  only  food.  Some  of 
them  found  a wild  fruit,  which  proved  to  be  unfit  for 
food ; for,  on  eating  it,  their  hair,  beards,  and  eye- 
brows fell  off,  and  the  horses  lost  their  hair,  and  died. 
After  wandering  for  a year,  in  this  forlorn  state,  they 
found  they  had  been  moving  in  a circle,  and  came 
to  the  spot  from  whence  they  had  set  out  full  of 
hope,  twelve  months  before. 

The  determination  of  the  intrepid  German,  to  con- 
tinue the  search  for  El  Dorado,  was  undiminished  by 
this  failure ; he  had  heard  of  a city  called  Macatoa 
from  the  Indian  ; and  he  once  more  started  with 
Pedro  de  Limpias,  who  was  known  to  be  brave  and 
quick  in  learning  languages,  and  forty  men.  After 
a long  march  they  reached  the  banks  of  the  river 
Guaviare,  where  Huten  met  with  an  Indian,  whom 
he  sent  as  an  envoy  to  Macatoa,  which  he  had  heard 
was  at  no  great  distance.  In  a few  days  five  canoes 
arrived,  with  the  chief’s  son,  who  ferried  them  across 
the  river,  and  supplied  them  with  venison,  fish,  maize, 
and  cassava.  The  explorers  were  then  conducted  to 
the  city,  which  they  found  to  consist  of  well-con- 
structed houses  (or  huts  1),  built  in  streets,  with  open 
spaces  at  intervals,  containing  about  eight  hundred 
inhabitants  of  the  Guaypis,  Guayupes,  or  Uaupes

tribe  of  Indians.  Their  chief  was  a man  about  forty 
years  of  age,  of  middling  stature,  well  built,  with  an 
aquiline  nose,  and  fine  countenance. 

The  chief  of  the  Uaupes  advised  Huten  not  to  ad- 
vance against  the  Omaguas,  a rich  and  powerful 
tribe  to  the  southward,  with  so  small  a force ; but 
he  added  that  they  possessed  much  gold  and  silver, 
which  was  a sufficient  inducement  to  the  explorers 
to  brave  all  dangers ; and  Huten  continued  his 
march,  with  guides  and  provisions.  This  dauntless 
commander  had  now  entered  the  country  which 
Mr.  Wallace,  as  late  as  1853,  calls  “ the  unknown 
regions  between  the  Rio  Guaviare  on  the  one  side, 
and  the  Japura,  on  the  other.”1  After  marching  for 
five  days  the  explorers  came  to  a village  of  fifty  huts, 
inhabited  by  Indians  appointed  to  guard  the  crops  of 
the  Omaguas.  Huten  and  his  companions,  from  this 
place,  saw  a town  of  such  size  that,  although  one 
part  of  it  was  very  close,  they  could  not  see  the  other 
end  of  it ; the  streets  were  straight,  with  the  houses 
touching  each  other ; and  there  was  an  edifice  of 
great  height  in  the  centre  of  the  town,  which,  ac- 
cording to  the  Indian  guides,  was  inhabited  by 
Quarica,  the  lord  of  the  Omaguas,  and  served  also  as 
a temple  for  many  idols  of  gold.  The  guides  added 
that  further  on  there  were  other  cities,  larger  and 
richer  than  this. 

Stimulated  by  the  stories  of  the  Indians,  Philip 
von  Huten  charged  down  the  hill,  towards  the  city, 
with  his  intrepid  little  band  ; but  the  Omaguas  came

out  of  the  city  in  great  force,  to  the  sound  of  drums; 
and  Iluten,  having  been  severely  wounded,  was 
obliged  to  retreat,  and  was  carried  off  the  field  in  a 
hammock,  by  his  friendly  Indian  guides.  The  re- 
treating Spaniards  were  followed  by  a large  army  of 
Omaguas,  who  harrassed  their  rear  until  they  were 
finally  repulsed  by  Pedro  de  Limpias,  but  this  stub- 
born resistance  of  the  Omaguas  put  an  end  to  the 
search  for  El  Dorado.  The  friendly  chief  of  the 
Uaupes  resorted  to  a strange  method  of  discovering 
the  means  of  curing  Huten’s  wound.  An  old  slave 
was  dressed  in  the  German  knight’s  armour,  and 
placed  upon  his  horse,  and,  while  in  this  position,  an 
Indian  wounded  him  in  the  same  way  that  the 
Omagua  had  wounded  Huten.  Thus,  by  cutting 
the  old  slave  up,  they  discovered  the  direction  of 
Huten’s  wound,  and  cured  him. 

The  explorers  now  recrossed  the  Guaviare,  and 
determined  to  return  to  Coro,  where  a melancholy  fate 
awaited  their  gallant  leader.  During  the  expedition 
a jealousy  had  arisen  between  Pedro  de  Limpias, 
the  maestro  del  campo,  and  Bartolome  Velser,  the 
lieutenant-general ; which  ended  in  the  former  de- 
serting Huten,  and  returning  to  Coro  before  him. 

The  land  discovered  by  Philip  von  Huten,  between 
the  Guaviare  and  the  Caqueta,  may  not  improbably 
have  been  inhabited,  in  those  days,  by  a very  popu- 
lous nation,  for  there  is  other  evidence  to  show  that 
the  Omaguas,  though  now  dwindled  to  a small  tribe 
on  the  banks  of  the  Amazons,  may  have  been  both 
powerful  and  numerous  in  the  days  of  Huten,  three

centuries  ago,  The  great  city  reported  by  Huten 
may  be  taken  to  mean  a populous  region  studded 
with  villages,  and  there  is  nothing  improbable  in  the 
rest  of  the  account  of  this  remarkable  expedition. 
Humboldt  thinks  it  likely  that  the  streamlets  which 
form  the  rivers  Uaupes  and  Caqueta,  flowing  through 
the  region  in  which  Huten  sought  for  El  Dorado, 
and  where  he  fought  the  battle  of  Omaguas  with  a 
handful  of  men,  may  be  auriferous  ; and  he  mentions 
that  though  the  Indian  tribes  of  this  region  have  no 
name  for  silver,  they  all  have  one  for  gold.  Be  this 
as  it  may,  the  expedition  of  Philip  von  Huten  created 
a great  sensation  throughout  the  New  World;  from 
that  time  the  name  of  the  Omaguas  was  coupled  with 
that  of  El  Dorado,  as  the  emblem  of  inexhaustible 
wealth ; and  from  the  days  of  Huten  to  those  of 
Humboldt  only  one  European1  explored  the  region 
between  the  Guaviare  and  the  Caqueta.2 

During  the  absence  of  the  expedition  in  search  of 
El  Dorado,  the  government  of  Venezuela  had 
been  seized  by  one  Carbajal,  a brutal  soldier,  who

2 The  expeditions  of  Gonzalo  Pizarro  to  Canela,  and  of  Orellana 
down  the  river  Amazon,  took  place  just  before  that  of  Philip  von 
Huten.  Orellana  sailed  down  the  Amazon,  and  heard  of  the 
Omaguas,  in  1540;  and  Huten  started  from  Coro  in  July  1541, 
the  month  previous  to  Orellana’s  arrival  at  the  mouth  of  the  Ama- 
zon. Humboldt  remarks  that  “ the  descendants  of  those  intrepid 
warriors  who  had  pushed  their  conquests  from  Peru  to  the  coast  of 
New  Granada,  and  the  mouth  of  the  Amazon,  were  ignorant  of  the 
roads  which  lead  from  Coro  to  the  river  Meta.”

arrested  Huten  and  Velser  on  their  return  to  Coro, 
caused  their  hands  to  be  tied,  and  their  heads  to  be 
cut,  or  rather  sawn  off  with  a blunt  macheta , which  had 
been  used  for  chopping  wood.  With  the  sad  deaths  of 
these  two  chivalrous  knights,  ended  the  rule  of  those 
Germans  in  Venezuela,  who  added  so  romantic  a page 
to  the  history  of  South  American  discovery.1  Carbajal 
continued  to  commit  many  excesses  ; and  in  1545  he 
founded  the  city  of  Tocuyo,  in  a beautiful  valley, 
producing  wheat,  cotton,  and  sugar-cane.  In  the 
same  year  the  Licentiate  Juan  Perez  de  Tolosa  of 
Segovia,  a learned  and  prudent  man,  was  sent  out  by 
the  emperor  to  settle  the  affairs  of  Venezuela,  and  in 
1546  he  tried  and  executed  Carbajal.2  The  Ger- 
mans were  deprived  of  the  government,  owing  to  the 
numerous  complaints  of  tyranny  and  disorder  that 
were  made  against  them,  insomuch  that  the  good 
Las  Casas  called  the  province  “ infeliz  y desgra- 
ciada.” 

For  several  years  the  Spaniards  occupied  them- 
selves more  in  settling  the  immediate  neighbour- 
hood of  the  coast,  than  in  exploring  expeditions. 
Tolosa’s  brother  crossed  the  Apure,  and  reached 
the  valley  of  Cucuta ; in  1547  Juan  de  Villegas 
discovered  the  lake  of  Tacarigua ; in  1549  Pedro 
Alvarez  founded  Burburata ; and  in  1552  Ville- 
gas founded  Barquisimeto.  Thus  the  province  of

Venezuela  was  gradually  colonized,  and  it  will 
only  be  necessary  to  mention  one  other  settler, 
because  he  appears  on  the  scene  in  the  narrative  of 
Aguirre’s  cruise.1  This  was  Francisco  de  Taxardo, 
the  son  of  a Spaniard  of  the  island  of  Margarita,  by 
an  Indian  princess  of  the  Guaigueri  nation.  He 
determined  to  form  a settlement  in  the  country  of 
Caraccas,  and,  sailing  from  Margarita  in  April  1555, 
in  two  piraguas  with  twenty  Indians  of  his  mother’s 
tribe,  was  well  received  by  the  natives  of  Caraccas, 
and  was  established  there  when  Aguirre  reached 
Margarita  in  156L 

While  the  Germans  were  searching  for  El  Dorado 
from  the  side  of  Venezuela,  the  course  of  events  in 
New  Granada  brings  Pedro  de  Ursua  on  the  scene ; 
the  principal  person  in  the  narrative  which  forms  the 
subject  of  the  present  volume. 

We  have  seen  that  Gonzalo  Ximenes  de  Quesada, 
the  great  conqueror  of  Bogota,  had  sailed  for  Spain 
to  obtain  the  government  of  his  new  discoveries.  In 
this  Quesada  failed,  and  Don  Luis  Alonzo  de  Lugo, 
the  son  of  his  former  comrade,  was  appointed 
Adelantado  of  the  new  kingdom  of  Granada;  but  his 
reign  was  very  brief.  He  reached  the  coast  in  1542, 
and  in  1545  the  Judge  Don  Miguel  Diaz  de  Armen- 
dariz  was  sent  out  by  the  Council  of  the  Indies,  to 
examine  into  his  conduct,  and  to  take  what  was  called 
a residencia  of  Carthagena,  Santa  Martha,  and 
Popayan,  with  full  powers.  Immediately  on  landing 
at  Carthagena,  Armendariz  received  numerous  com-

plaints  of  the  tyranny  of  Lugo,  from  persons  who  had 
been  banished  from  Bogota ; and  he  appointed  his 
young  nephew,  Don  Pedro  de  Ursua,  to  proceed  to 
that  city  and  take  charge  of  the  government,  whilst 
he  completed  his  examination  into  the  state  of  affairs 
on  the  coast.  Ursua  was  accompanied  by  Gonzalo 
Suarez  Rondon,  the  founder  of  Ronda,  and  other 
exiles,  who  had  been  banished  by  Lugo,  and  they 
proceeded  up  the  Magdalena  in  light  canoes.  Ursua 
was  received  at  Tunja  as  Governor,  but,  during  the 
night,  the  house  in  which  he  was  lodged  wTas  burnt  to 
the  ground,  and  this  served  as  a pretext  for  arresting 
Lugo,  and  confining  him  in  prison.  Ursua  then  con- 
tinued his  journey  to  Bogota,  where  he  administered 
the  government  until  the  arrival  of  his  uncle  Armen- 
dariz,  whose  first  act  was  to  torture  a citizen,  to  force 
him  to  disclose  the  persons  who  had  set  fire  to  Ursua’s 
house  at  Tunja. 

Pedro  de  Ursua  was  a knight  of  Navarre,  and  it 
was  considered,  at  the  time,  that  he  was  too  young 
and  inexperienced  for  the  important  post  entrusted  to 
him  by  his  uncle ; yet  he  proved  himself,  during  the 
short  period  of  his  rule,  to  be  equal  to  the  best  ad- 
ministrators that  had  ever  served  in  the  Indies.  He 
is  said  to  have  been  a youth,  who  united  a good 
education  and  great  sweetness  and  amiability  of 
temper,  to  uncommon  bravery  and  dexterity  in  mar- 
tial exercises.  Garcilasso  Inca  de  la  Vega,  who 
knew  him  in  Peru,  says  that  he  was  a generous  and 
honourable  man,  a perfect  gentleman,  and  generally 
liked  ; so  that,  when  he  was  collecting  supplies  for

his  expedition,  people  readily  gave  him  all  he  wanted, 
because  he  was  an  universal  favourite.1  It  was 
natural  that  a young  knight  of  such  a disposition,  on 
hearing  the  accounts  of  the  expeditions  of  Alfinger, 
George  of  Spires,  Fedreman,  Quesada,  and  Philip  von 
Huten,  in  search  of  El  Dorado  and  the  Omaguas, 
should  be  inspired  with  a longing  to  emulate  their 
chivalrous  deeds,  and  to  make  a name  for  himself 
also,  as  an  intrepid  explorer  of  unknown  regions. 
Accordingly,  Armendariz,  at  his  own  urgent  request, 
appointed  him  to  the  command  of  an  expedition  to 
search  for  the  snowy  mountains  which  George  of 
Spires  and  Fedreman  were  reported  to  have  seen 
from  a distance,  and  for  the  rivers  which  flowed  over 
sands  of  gold. 

Ursua,  and  his  friend  Ortun  de  Velasco,  assembled 
a force  of  400  men,  who  expressed  their  desire  to 
serve  under  so  noble  a youth,  and  in  1548  they  left 
Tunja  and  directed  their  course  to  the  north-eastward. 
The  expedition  crossed  the  river  Sogamoso,  and 
entered  the  land  of  the  Laches  Indians,  whence  they 
advanced  to  the  country  of  the  Chitareros,  where 
Ursua  founded  a city,  which  he  named  after  his 
native  town  in  Navarre.  This  new  Pampluna  was 
laid  out  on  a regular  plan,  with  one  hundred  and 
thirty-six  lots  for  houses,  and  in  April  1549  the 
officers  of  the  new  city  were  nominated.  It  is  70 
leagues  N.E.  of  Bogota,  in  the  eastern  cordillera,  the 
climate  is  cold,  but  suitable  for  the  cultivation  of 
corn,  and  at  that  time  the  immediate  neighbourhood

was  inhabited  by  200,000  Chitareros  Indians.  Ursua 
remained  here  until  1550,  when  he  resigned  the 
command  to  Ortun  de  Velasco,  who  governed  the 
new  city1  for  twenty  years,  and  had  the  satisfaction 
of  drawing  and  quartering  the  murderer  of  his  old 
comrade’s  lady  love,  after  the  defeat  and  death  of  the 
monster  Aguirre  in  1561. 2 

While  Ursua  was  absent  on  his  Pampluna  expedi- 
tion, his  uncle,  Armendariz,  commenced  the  promul- 
gation of  the  new  laws,  which  caused  such  excite- 
ment in  the  New  World,  and  which,  in  Peru,  led  to 
the  death  of  the  viceroy  Blasco  Nunez  de  Vela,  and 
the  rebellion  of  Gonzalo  Pizarro.  Armendariz  sent 
copies  of  these  new  laws  to  Sebastian  de  Belalcazar, 
with  orders  to  publish  them  at  Popayan,  but  they 
were  as  ill  received  by  the  colonists  of  Cauca  as  they 
had  been  in  Peru.  Belalcazar,  however,  was  a wiser 
man  than  the  rash  Gonzalo  Pizarro;  he  represented 
to  the  people  the  fatal  consequences  of  disobeying 
their  sovereign,  and  advised  them  to  send  a deputa- 
tion, to  pray  for  the  repeal  of  the  obnoxious  ordi- 
nances.3 At  the  same  time  the  astute  Belalcazar 
evaded  the  orders  he  had  received,  by  promulgating 
the  new  laws,  and  on  the  same  day  suspending  them 

1 The  province  of  Pampluna  extended  from  the  river  Zulia  to 
the  lake  of  Maracaibo ; and  by  this  route  came  the  merchandize 
of  Castille,  until  the  rising  of  the  Quiriquies  Indians  took  place, 
who  were  many  years  masters  of  the  banks  of  the  Maracaibo  Lake, 
and  destroyed  its  navigation.

until  further  directions  were  received  from  Spain  ; 
and  it  was  at  this  time  that  the  derisive  saying  origi- 
nated, which  afterwards  became  so  common  in 
Spanish  America,  “ Se  obedece  pero  no  se  cumple .”1 

In  1549,  and  in  the  midst  of  these  difficulties, 
Armendariz  was  superseded  by  a Royal  Audience, 
consisting  of  lawyers,  named  Mercado  (who  died  at 
Mompox  on  his  way),  Gongora,  and  Galarza.  Ar- 
mendariz resigned  his  office  to  the  two  latter,  who 
were  young  and  ignorant,  but  conciliatory  and 
upright,  and  inclined  to  exercise  the  office  of  peace- 
makers ; so  that  when,  shortly  afterwards,  the  lawyer 
Zurite  arrived  to  take  a residencia  of  Armendariz, 
against  whom  complaints  were  not  wanting,  not  of 
avarice  and  peculation,  however,  the  almost  invaria- 
ble cry  against  functionaries  in  the  Indies,  but  of 
sensuality,  he  was  let  off  very  easily.  The  com- 
plainers  then  wrote  to  the  Council  of  the  Indies,  who, 
very  unfairly  sent  out  a severe  man,  named  Montano, 
to  take  another  residencia , and  Armendariz  was  this 
time  sent  to  Spain,  and  so  heavily  fined,  that  the 
alguazils  took  the  cloak  from  his  back,  to  pay  their 
fees.  On  his  arrival  in  Spain,  Armendariz  became  a 

1 While  I was  at  Puno,  in  Southern  Peru,  last  year,  I was  told 
an  anecdote  of  a Spanish  intendente,  who  imitated  the  conduct  of 
Belalcazar.  Gonzalez  Montoya,  the  intendente  in  question,  a 
benevolent,  as  well  as  a determined  man,  governed  Puno  towards 
the  end  of  the  last  century.  He  abolished  the  mitas  of  Indians  in 
his  district,  for  the  mines  of  Potosi,  which  he  declared  to  be  a 
system  of  butchery ; and,  when  ordered  by  the  Spanish  government 
to  re-establish  them,  he,  like  Belalcazar,  exclaimed  “ Obeclesco 
pero  no  cumplo .”

presbyter,  and  the  third  governor  of  New  Granada 
died  a canon  in  Siguenza.  His  persecutor  Montano 
was,  not  long  afterwards,  beheaded  for  rebellion  and 
cruelty. 

The  downfall  of  Armendariz  does  not  appear  to 
have  immediately  affected  the  fortunes  of  his  nephew  ; 
for  in  1549  the  auditors  appointed  Ursua  to  conduct 
an  expedition  against  the  Musos  Indians,  who  had 
recently  defeated  a Captain  Valdez,  and  to  search 
for  El  Dorado.  Ursua’s  party  consisted  of  one  hun- 
dred and  fifty  men,  and  it  is  related  that  they  had 
plenty  of  powder,  but  so  little  lead  that  they  melted 
half  the  utensils  in  the  colony  to  make  bullets. 
They  entered  the  territory  of  the  Musos,  and  en- 
trenched themselves  in  a strong  position,  but  met 
with  much  resistance  from  the  natives.  At  length 
Ursua  made  a truce  with  them,  and  a sort  of  fair  was 
held  near  his  camp;  when  he  invited  the  chiefs  to 
come  in,  and  treacherously  murdered  them,  “ a felo- 
nious act,”  says  the  chronicler,  tc  and  unworthy  of 
a soldier  of  honour,  like  Ursua.”  The  Navarrese 
knight  then  founded  a city  named  Tudela,  and  re- 
turned to  Bogota  for  reinforcements,  which  he  con- 
ducted to  his  new  settlement  by  another  road.  In 
1552,  however,  the  Spaniards  were  so  constantly 
attacked  by  the  brave  Musos,  that  they  retired  from 
their  new  city  of  Tudela,  and  their  enemies  burnt  it 
before  their  eyes. 

No  Spaniard  entered  the  country  of  the  Musos  for 
some  years  after  this  repulse ; and  this  gallant  tribe 
of  Indians  strove  for  their  independence,  with  a con-

stancy  and  valour  worthy  of  better  success,  for,  in 
the  end,  they  were  subjugated.  They  recognized  no 
chief,  but  followed  the  bravest  in  war,  and  the  oldest 
in  council ; and  their  chief  places  of  worship  were 
two  high  rocks,  near  the  river  Zarbi,  where  they 
offered  maize,  potatos,  and  yucas.1 

After  his  return  from  the  country  of  the  Musos, 
in  1551,  Pedro  de  Ursua  was  appointed  justicia 
mayor  of  Santa  Martha ; and  he  immediately  began 
to  prepare  for  the  conquest  of  the  Tayronas,  one  of 
the  most  warlike  of  the  Indian  tribes,  who  dwelt  in  the 
mountains  overhanging  the  town  and  valley.  Their 
country  was  rich  in  gold  and  silver,  and  they  made 
gold  ornaments,  in  the  shape  of  snakes,  toads,  eagles, 
deer,  crescents,  and  bats ; many  of  which  are  often 
dug  up  at  the  present  day,  closely  resembling  those 
which  have  been  lately  discovered  at  Chiriqui,  on  the 
isthmus  of  Panama.  In  1552  Ursua,  having  col- 
lected the  necessary  arms  and  supplies,  marched  out 
of  Santa  Martha,  and  penetrated  far  into  the  moun- 
tains ; but  the  Tayrona  Indians  retreated  before  him, 
harassing  his  outposts,  and  cutting  off  his  supplies, 
until  he  was  reduced  to  great  straits.  At  length 
Ursua  was  attacked  by  fever,  and  commenced  a re- 
treat, when  the  whole  tribe  of  Indians  occupied  a 
dangerous  part  of  the  road,  with  a precipice  on  one 
side,  and  a wall  of  rock  on  the  other,  called  the

ward), Velez,  and  Tunja.

Pasos  de  Rodrigo,  with  the  intention  of  disputing  the 
passage  of  the  invaders.  The  Spaniards  encamped 
near  this  narrow  pass,  and  were  roused,  towards 
morning,  by  the  shouts  of  the  Indians,  and  by  the 
blows  of  their  war  clubs.  Ursua  was  in  his  tent  with 
the  fever  upon  him,  but  he  rushed  out,  well  armed, 
but  only  half  dressed,  and  with  but  one  shoe  on  ; 
and  found  his  little  army  surrounded  by  the  enemy. 
With  twelve  men  he  led  the  way  up  the  craggy 
rocks,  to  gain  the  head  of  the  pass,  stones  were 
hurled  down  upon  him  from  the  summit,  but  he 
reached  the  important  post,  fought  like  a lion  for  three 
hours,  and  at  length  the  Tayronas  wavered,  and, 
seizing  the  critical  moment,  the  Spaniards  charged 
and  scattered  them.1 

Ursua  then  returned  to  Santa  Martha,  but,  being 
evidently  of  a very  restless  disposition,  and  disgusted 
with  the  insufficient  means  at  his  command  for  con- 
quering the  Tayronas,  he  threw  up  his  appointment, 
and  sailed  for  Nombre  de  Dios,  with  the  intention  of 
going  to  Peru.  At  Panama  he  met  with  the  Mar- 
quis of  Canete,  the  new  viceroy  of  Peru,  then  on  his 
way  to  Lima,  who  had  already  heard  of  his  adven- 
turous career  in  New  Granada.  At  that  time  the 
isthmus  of  Panama  was  infested  by  large  numbers  of 
runaway  negro  slaves,  called  Cimarrones,  who  fre- 
quented the  road  from  Nombre  de  Dios  to  Panama, 
robbing  and  murdering  all  who  fell  into  their  hands. 
The  Marquis  of  Canete  recommended  the  Cabildo  of 
Panama  to  secure  the  services  of  Pedro  de  Ursua,

to  command  a force  for  the  extirpation  of  these 
marauders  ; and  that  captain  soon  afterwards  entered 
the  tangled  forests,  with  a body  of  two  hundred 
Spaniards.  The  negro  chief,  named  Bayano,  endea- 
voured to  tire  out  his  pursuers  by  long  counter- 
marches, and  sudden  night  attacks ; the  encounters 
were  numerous,  most  of  them  hand  to  hand  between 
the  swords  of  the  Spaniards  and  the  machetas  or  wood 
knives  of  the  negros ; but,  in  the  course  of  two 
years,  nearly  the  whole  of  the  Cimarrones  were 
killed,  and  the  remainder  surrendered,  and  returned 
to  their  masters.1  After  this  very  toilsome,  but  com- 
pletely successful  campaign,  Ursua  departed  from 
Panama,  and  sailed  for  Peru,  in  search  of  employ- 
ment and  distinction  ; and  it  was  at  Lima,  in  1559, 
that  he  received,  from  the  viceroy  Marquis  of 
Canete,  the  command  of  the  expedition  in  search  of 
El  Dorado,  and  the  Omaguas,  the  extraordinary  nar- 
rative of  which  forms  the  subject  of  the  present 
volume. 

The  marquis  of  Canete,  who  was  viceroy  of  Peru 
from  1555  to  1561,  arrived  shortly  after  the  sup- 
pression of  a revolt  headed  by  Francisco  Hernandez 
Giron,2  and  found  the  country  in  great  disorder,

Conquest  of  America,  vol.  iv,  p.  290-96.  See  also  note  at  p.  232  of 
this  volume.  It  was  reported,  while  Giron  was  at  Nasca,  in  the 
course  of  his  rebellion,  that  Ursua  had  arrived  at  Piura,  and  de- 
clared for  Giron.  This  shows  that  Ursua  was  a captain  of  some 
renown,  and  that  his  name  was  known  throughout  South  Ame- 
rica.— G.  de  la  Vega.  Com.  Real.,  ii,  p.  429.

and  infested  by  disbanded  soldiers,  and  lawless  cha- 
racters of  every  description.  He  commenced  his 
administration  by  several  acts  of  great  severity,  of 
which  the  traitor  Aguirre  complained  bitterly  in  his 
letter  to  king  Philip  and  the  expedition  of  Ursua 
exactly  suited  his  policy,  because  it  enabled  him  to 
get  rid  of  a great  number  of  lawless  ruffians  from  all 
parts  of  Peru,  who,  now  that  the  civil  wars  were  at 
an  end,  were  prowling  over  the  country  without 
employment.  It  is  probable,  however,  that  the 
viceroy,  in  common  with  the  rest  of  his  countrymen, 
also  believed  firmly  in  the  tales  concerning  El  Dorado 
and  the  Omaguas,  which  were  brought  directly  to  his 
notice  in  the  following  way. 

It  appears  that  on  the  coast  of  Brazil  there  was  a 
valorous  Indian  chief,  named  Viraratu,  probably  of 
the  nation  of  Tupinambas,  who  assembled  a large 
body  of  warlike  men  in  a fleet  of  canoes,  with  arms 
and  food,  intending  to  enter  the  river  Maraiion,  and 
conquer  other  lands.  He  was  accompanied  by  two 
Portuguese,  who  knew  his  language.  After  ascending 
the  river  Maraiion  for  some  days,  they  came  to  a 
great  lake,  in  a vast  plain  surrounded  by  lofty  moun- 
tains, with  so  many  and  such  large  villages  on  its 
shores,  that  the  Brazilians  were  astonished.  The 
natives  collected  a great  fleet  of  canoes,  and  a naval 
battle  followed,  in  which  the  invaders  were  defeated. 
Viraratu,  therefore,  returned  to  the  river,  but  the 
people  of  the  lake  followed  him,  and  shot  arrows 
from  both  sides.  The  Brazilians  continued  to  ascend

the  great  river  steadily,  until  they  at  length  reached 
Moyobamba,  near  the  river  Huallaga  in  Peru,  a dis- 
trict inhabited  by  the  Motilones  Indians.1  Viraratu 
talked  to  these  people  by  signs,  and  related  how  he 
had  left  Brazil,  all  that  he  had  seen,  the  numerous 
villages  he  passed  on  the  river,  and  the  quantities  of 
gold  and  silver  which  they  ought  to  contain.  He  was 
then  sent  to  Lima,  where  the  marquis  of  Canete  heard 
his  story,  and  saw  some  of  the  gold  he  brought  with 
him  ; and  it  was  the  report  of  Viraratu  which  led  to 
the  organization  of  the  expedition  in  search  of  El 
Dorado  and  Omagua,  under  Don  Pedro  de  Ursua, 
in  1559. 2 

I will  now  proceed  to  give  some  account  of  the 
authors  to  whom  we  are  indebted  for  narratives  of 
the  expedition  of  Ursua  and  Aguirre  down  the  river 
Maranon,  the  fullest  and  best  of  which,  that  of  Fray 
Pedro  Simon,  has  been  translated  for  the  Hak- 
luyt Society.  The  career  of  Aguirre  is  certainly  the 
most  marvellous  and  extraordinary  in  the  history  of 
South  American  discovery,  during  that  age  of  won- 
ders, the  sixteenth  century  ; yet  the  sources  from 
which  the  story  has  been  derived,  are  authentic  and 
trustworthy. 

I.  The  earliest  account  extant,  of  the  expedition 
of  Ursua  and  Aguirre,  is  contained  in  a manuscript, 

1 They  are  so  called  because  they  have  a custom  of  shaving  their 
heads. — Vasquez  MS. 

2 This  account  of  the  expedition  of  the  Brazilian  Indians  under 
Viraratu,  up  the  Amazon,  is  taken  from  a manuscript  in  the 
National  Library  at  Madrid,  “ Jornada  del  Rio  Maranon , por 
Toribio  de  Ortiyuera ,”  J.  143.  The  handwriting  is  very  illegible.

now  in  the  national  library  at  Madrid,  actually  written 
by  a soldier  who  accompanied  them  down  the  Ama- 
zon, and  who  witnessed  all  the  horrors  he  relates, 
until  he  made  his  escape  at  the  island  of  Margarita. 
This  was  the  Bachiller  Francisco  Vasquez,  one  of 
the  three  loyal  men  who,  when  the  mutineers  fore- 
swore allegiance  to  the  king,  boldly  refused  to  be 
accomplices  in  their  treason.1  The  other  two  were 
Juan  de  Cabanas,  and  Juan  de  Vargas  Zapata. 
Cabanas  was  murdered  by  Aguirre,  for  some  imagi- 
nary offence,  soon  afterwards,2  but  Vasquez  effected 
his  escape,  while  the  traitors  were  detained  at  Mar- 
garita.3 The  prefix  of  Bachiller  seems  to  show  that 
Vasquez,  though  in  the  position  of  a private  soldier, 
was  a man  of  some  education  ; and  it  would  thus 
appear  that  men  of  all  ranks  crowded  to  these 
El  Dorado  expeditions,  just  as  they  did  to  the  Sacra- 
mento, during  the  Californian  gold  fever. 

The  manuscript  is  entitled, 44  A narrative  of  all  that 
happened  in  the  expedition  to  Amagua  and  Dorado, 
which  the  governor  Pedro  de  Ursua  went  to  discover, 
with  powers  given  him  by  the  viceroy  marquis  of 
Canete,  president  of  Peru : treating  also  of  the 

mutiny  of  Don  Hernando  de  Guzman,  Lope  de 
Aguirre,  and  other  tyrants.”  It  is  particularly  inter- 
esting, because  it  is  the  source  from  which  Simon 
obtained  his  information, — indeed  page  after  page  of 
Simon  is  transcribed  word  for  word  from  the  manu- 
script of  Vasquez.  No  source  of  information  could 
be  more  authentic.  All  the  remarks,  at  page  21  of

this  volume,  on  the  sources  of  the  liver  Cocam  a or 
Ucayali ; and  at  page  107  on  the  Marafion,  are  taken 
from  Vasquez,  as  well  as  the  description  of  Aguirre, 
at  the  end  of  Simon’s  narrative.1 

On  the  last  page  of  the  manuscript,  the  following 
notice  is  written : — “ This  narrative  was  made  by  a 
soldier  named  the  Bachiller  Francisco  Vasquez,  a 
soldier  of  the  tyrant  Aguirre,  and  one  of  those  who 
refused  to  take  the  oath  to  Don  Fernando  de  Guz- 
man, as  prince,  nor  to  foreswear  their  country,  nor  to 
deny  their  king  and  lord.  Credit  may  be  given  to  his 
account,  and  to  all  he  writes,  because  he  was  an 
honest  and  upright  man,  and  he  accompanied  the 
tyrant,  who  always  treated  him  very  well,  both  him 
and  the  others  who  refused  to  join  in  the  rebellion.2 
For,  when  the  rebellion  commenced,  the  said  tyrant 
and  Don  Fernando  declared  to  all  the  camp  that 
those  who  desired  to  join  the  rebellion  of  their  own 
free  will  could  do  so,  and  that  those  who  desired  not 
to  join  it  would  not  be  forced  to  do  so  : therefore 
those  who  were  rebels  against  the  lord  our  king  had 
no  excuse,  and  are  deserving  of  the  severest  punish- 
ment.” 

II.  There  is  another  contemporaneous  manuscript 
account  of  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and  Aguirre,  in 
the  national  library  at  Madrid,  by  Don  Toribio  de

2 This  is  not  exactly  true,  for  he  murdered  Juan  de  Cabanas 
(see  p.  101),  and  would  have  done  the  same  to  Vasquez,  if  he 
could  have  caught  him  (see  p.  128).

Maranon,  with  all  that  happened  in  it,  and  other 
notable  events,  worthy  to  be  known,  which  happened 
in  the  Western  Indies;  dedicated  to  the  most  happy 
Don  Philip  III,  our  lord.”1  Ortiguera  was  at  Nom- 
bre  de  Dios  in  1561,  and  sent  some  forces  against 
Aguirre.  He  remained  in  South  America  until 
1585,  and  returned  to  Spain  after  an  absence  of 
twenty-five  years.  He  heard  all  the  details  of  the 
unhappy  expedition  down  the  Maranon  from  many 
persons,  and  was  thus  enabled  to  write  a history  of 
it,  which  differs  in  no  material  point  from  that  of 
Vasquez.  It  consists  of  fifty*  six  short  chapters,  two 
of  which  relate  to  the  expeditions  of  Gonzalo  Pizarro 
and  Orellana,  and  all  the  rest  to  Aguirre’s  piratical 
cruise.  This  writer  declares  that,  never  since  the  civil 
wars  in  Peru,  have  such  strange  and  wonderful  things 
happened,  as  in  this  affair  of  the  river  Maranon.2

2 There  is  another  interesting  manuscript,  containing  information 
on  the  river  Amazon,  in  the  national  library  at  Madrid.  It  is 
entitled  “ The  Discovery  of  the  river  of  the  Amazons,  and  its  ex- 
tensive provinces : a report  sent  to  the  most  excellent  Lord  Don 
Garcia  Mendoza  de  Haro,  count  of  Castrillo,  president  of  the

captain-general  of  the  new  kingdom  of  Granada,  and  president  of 
the  Royal  Audience.  1639.” 

It  is  a well-written  official  report,  in  which  the  captain-general 
states  that  he  has  received  a narrative  respecting  the  river  Ama- 
zon from  Quito,  containing  geographical  and  other  details  supplied 
by  Texeira.  There  is  a curious  coloured  map  with  it. — Papeles

III.  The  first  published  account  of  the  expedition  of 
Ursua  and  Aguirre,  is  contained  in  the  “ Elegias 1 de 
IUustres  Varones  de  Indias by  the  Presbitero  Juan 
de  Castellanos.  This  writer  was  originally  a soldier, 
and  served  in  the  conquest  of  New  Granada,  but,  like 
many  others,  he  changed  his  life  and  became  a priest, 
first  at  Carthagena,  and  afterwards  at  Tunja,  where 
he  remained  many  years,  writing  his  “ Elegias”  first 
in  prose,  and  then  turning  them  into  verse.  The  first 
part  was  printed  in  Spain  in  1588,  and  contained  the 
exploits  of  Columbus  ; Ponce  de  Leon  ; Francisco  de 
Garay  in  Cuba ; the  conquest  of  Trinidad,  the  Ori- 
noco, and  Cubagua ; and  finally  the  expedition  of 
Ursua  and  Aguirre.  A second  part  followed,  but  was 
never  published  until  1847,  giving  an  account  of  the 
deeds  of  the  German  knights  in  Venezuela,  searching 
for  El  Dorado ; and  a third,  relating  the  conquest  of 
Carthagena  by  Lugo,  of  Popayan  by  Belalcazar,  and 
of  Antiochia.2  The  fourth  part,  containing  the 
conquest  of  New  Granada,  was  never  printed,  and 

1 This  word  here  means  eulogies,  not  elegies. 

2 An  edition  of  the  three  existing  parts  was  published  at 
Madrid  in  1847,  in  the  library  of  Spanish  authors,  edited  by  Don 
Buenaventura  Carlos  Aribau.  The  poet  Alonzo  de  Ercilla  acted 
as  censor  to  the  second  and  third  parts  of  the  work,  and,  in  the 
beginning,  records  his  opinion  that  many  events,  which  he  either 
saw  or  heard  of  when  he  was  in  the  Indies,  are  faithfully  and  truth- 
fully recorded  by  Castellanos,  accounts  of  which  had  never  before 
been  written  by  any  author. 

Ticknor  says,  “ The  whole,  except  the  conclusion,  is  written  in 
the  Italian  octave  stanza,  and  extends  to  nearly  ninety  thousand 
lines,  in  pure,  fluent  Castilian,  which  soon  afterwards  became  rare, 
but  in  a chronicling  spirit,  which,  though  it  adds  to  its  value  as  a

is  lost ; but  Piedrahita  had  the  use  of  the  original 
manuscript.  No  copy,  however,  has  been  found  in 
modern  times. 

Castellanos  was  a patient  investigator,  and  wrote  in 
a clear  simple  style,  with  an  extensive  personal  know- 
ledge of  the  localities  he  describes.  He  is  by  far  the 
most  genial  historian  of  Ursua’s  expedition. 

The  history  of  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and 
Aguirre  is  contained  in  Parte  i,  Elegia  xiv,  and 
Cantos  ii  to  vii  of  the  work  of  Castellanos.  He 
gives  a tolerably  detailed  account  of  all  the  principal 
events,  and  his  information  was  probably*  derived 
from  the  same  sources  as  that  of  Ortiguera,  namely, 
from  men  who  were  actually  eyewitnesses  of,  and, 
perhaps,  actors  in  the  events  which  they  described. 
Castellanos’  version  of  the  bloody  career  of  Aguirre 
is  remarkable,  because  he  stands  up  as  the  champion 
of  the  unfortunate  lady  who  accompanied  Ursua  ; 
while  all  other  writers,  whether  they  be  men  of  the 
world,  like  Vasquez  and  Ortiguera,  or  greasy  friars, 
like  Simon  and  Piedrahita,  unite  in  heaping  re- 
proaches and  calumnies  upon  her. 

Vasquez  says  that  the  lady  went,  against  the  advice 
of  Ursua’s  friends,  that  she  was  said  to  be  a person 
of  bad  character  and  worse  manners,  and  that  she 
was  the  principal  cause  of  the  murder  of  Ursua 

history,  takes  from  it  all  the  best  characteristics  of  poetry.” — 
History  of  Spanish  Literature , ii,  p.  435. 

Colonel  Acosta,  in  his  history  of  the  discovery  of  New  Granada, 
says  that  Castellanos  is  very  inexact. 

1 Garcilasso  de  la  Vega  says,  with  reference  to  this  poor  lady, 
11  Love  has  destroyed  many  great  captains,  Hannibal,  and  others.”

Ortiguera  makes  similar  insinuations ; and  Simon1 
copies  from  Vasquez  ; but  Castellanos,  like  the  true 
gentleman  that  he  evidently  was,  defends  the  memory 
of  the  poor  young  lady.  The  truth  seems  to  have 
been  that  Dona  Inez  de  Atienza,  the  beautiful  young 
widow  of  a citizen  of  Piura,  fell  passionately  in  love 
with  Don  Pedro  de  Ursua,  when  he  arrived  in  Peru. 
Pedro  de  Ursua  was  a young  knight  of  Navarre,  hand- 
some, brave,  and  generous,  possessed  of  many  noble 
qualities,  and  universally  liked  ; he  had,  though  still 
young,  already  acquitted  himself  well  in  more  than 
one  post  of  great  danger  and  responsibility,  and  the 
fame  of  his  exploits  had  gone  before  him  into  Peru.2 
Inez  de  Atienza,  a young,  beautiful,  and  spirited

the  lady  Inez,  p.  87. 

2 Castellanos  thus  describes  him  : — 

a Salio  buen  capitan  y diligente 
Para  le  cometer  qualquier  jornada 

Y ansi,  por  aqui  daba  buena  cuenta 
En  los  negocios  de  mayor  afrenta 
Descubrio  los  caminos  mas  rigorosos 
Allano  la  montaha  rigorosa 
Conquisto  la  provincia  de  los  Musos 
Deste  reino  la  mas  dificultosa. 

Vile  hacer  a la  real  corona 
Otros  muchos  servicios  senalados 

Y en  Santa  Marta  recorrio  la  Sierra, 

Puesto  que  sin  victoria  deste  guerra.” —

Piedrahita  says  that,  in  his  expeditions,  it  was  not  so  much 
Ursua’s  desire  to  amass  riches,  for  their  own  sake,  to  which  he 
was  always  indifferent,  as  to  reap  the  glory  of  conquering  new 
countries  for  his  king. — Pte.  i,  lib.  xi,  cap.  ix,  p.  692.

woman,  as  both  Vasquez  and  Simon  allow,  gave  him 
her  heart ; but  her’s  was  no  common  love  ; it  is  not 
every  woman,  gently  nurtured  and  accustomed  to  the 
comforts  of  civilized  life,  who  would  have  willingly 
encountered  the  appalling  hardships  of  a search  for 
El  Dorado,  and  a voyage  down  the  great  river.  At 
all  events  there  is  only  one  other  instance  of  such 
devotion  on  record  : Inez  de  Atienza  and  Madame 
Godin1  are  the  two  heroines  of  the  river  Amazon ; 
they  stand  alone,  and  their  romantic  stories  are  almost 
unrivalled  in  the  history  of  woman’s  love.  The  very 
sublimity  of  this  noble  creature’s  devotion,  which  no 
terrors  could  daunt,  no  hardships  damp,  ought  to 
have  protected  her  from  the  cowardly  sneers  of  dirty 
friars,  and  the  calumnies  of  gold-seeking  adventurers. 
The  lady  Inez  “ forsook  not  her  lord,  in  his  travels, 
unto  death and  her  heroism  and  her  sorrows 
almost  hallow  a love,  which  may  not  have  been  sanc- 
tioned by  a priest.2  If  she  was  guilty  of  any  fault, 
after  the  death  of  Ursua,  which  Simon  asserts,  and 
which  I do  not  believe,3  let  it  be  remembered  that 
the  poor  broken-hearted  girl  was  utterly  helpless, 
and  in  the  hands  of  incarnate  fiends,  with  hearts 
harder  than  the  nether  mill  stone.  That  mad  devil

note  at  p.  liv  of  the  introduction  to  “ The  Expeditions  into  the 
Valley  of  the  Amazons”  (Hakluyt  Society’s  Publications,  1859). 

3 Yet  even  this  is  doubtful ; for  Simon  allows  that  Ursua  took 
the  lady  Inez  to  Moyobamba,  with  the  intention  of  marrying  her, 
and  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  did  not  do  so.  See  p.  13.

not  find  it  stated  by  Vasquez.

Aguirre  finally  caused  her  to  be  murdered,  because 
her  mattress  would  take  up  too  much  room  in  the 
boat ! and  Castellanos  writes  more  like  a pastoral 
poet  than  a rhyming  chronicler,  when  he  records  the 
cruel  deed  : — “ The  birds  mourned  on  the  trees,  the 
wild  beasts  of  the  forests  lamented,  the  waters  ceased 
to  murmur,  the  fish  groaned  beneath  them,  the  winds 
execrated  the  deed,  when  Llamoso  cut  the  veins  of 
her  white  neck.  Wretch  ! art  thou  born  of  a woman  1 
No  ! What  beast  brought  forth  a son  so  wicked  ? 
How  is  it  that  thou  dost  not  die  in  imagining  a 
treason  so  enormous'?  Her  two  women,  amidst 
lamentations  and  grief,  gathered  flowers  to  cover  her 
grave,  and  cut  her  epitaph  in  the  bark  of  a tree  : — 
4 These  flowers  cover  one  whose  faithfulness  and 
beauty  were  unequalled,  whom  cruel  men  slew  with- 
out a cause.’  ” 

IV.  All  the  authorities  already  mentioned,  namely 
Vasquez,  Ortiguera,  and  Castellanos,  were  contempo- 
raries of  Aguirre.  The  next  chronicler  of  his  career, 
Fray  Pedro  Simon,1  lived  some  years  afterwards  ; but 
his  account  has  been  selected  for  translation  in  pre- 
ference to  the  others,  because  it  is  by  far  the  fullest, 
and  is  equally  reliable  and  authentic.  Pedro  Simon 
was  born  at  Parrilla,  near  Cuenca,  in  1574,  thirteen 
years  after  the  death  of  Aguirre.  He  was  educated 
in  the  convent  of  San  Francisco  de  Cartagena  in 
Spain,  and,  in  1604,  was  sent  out  to  South  America,

to  teach  theology  and  the  arts,  in  the  convent  of  his 
order  at  Bogota.  In  1607  he  accompanied  Don 
Juan  de  Borja,1  the  President  of  the  Audience,  in  his 
campaign  against  the  Pijaos  Indians,  travelled 
through  Venezuela,  embarked  at  Coro  for  the 
Antilles,  and  returned  to  Bogota.  He  also  made 
journeys  to  Antioquia,  Carthagena,  and  Santa 
Martha,  and  conversed  with  some  of  the  conquerors 
and  settlers,  while  many  of  the  incidents  of  the 
conquest  were  still  fresh  in  their  memories,  before 
he  began  to  write  his  history.  He  is  said  to  have 
suffered  severely  from  gout. 

In  1623  Simon  began  to  write  his  “ noticias 
historiales ,”  for  which  he  had  been  collecting  ma- 
terials for  many  years.  The  first  part,  the  only  one 
ever  printed,  appeared  at  Cuenca  in  1627  ; and  con- 
sists of  seven  “ noticias  ’ treating  of  the  affairs  of  Vene- 
zuela, and  of  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and  Aguirre. 
The  other  two  parts,  also  composed  of  seven  noticias 
each,  exist  only  in  manuscript.  The  second  relates 
the  discoveries  on  the  right  bank  of  the  river  Mag- 
dalena, from  Santa  Martha ; and  the  third  relates 
the  conquests  of  Carthagena,  Popayan,  Antioquia, 
and  Choco  ; and  is  said,  by  Colonel  Acosta,  to  be  the 
most  complete  and  most  valuable  account  of  the  affairs 
of  New  Granada  in  the  sixteenth  century,  in  existence. 
Simon  is,  on  the  whole,  a trustworthy  writer ; his 
style  is  simple,  and  without  any  attempt  to  imitate 

1 Grandson  of  the  duke  of  Gandia  (who  was  general  of  the 
Jesuits,  and  afterwards  canonized),  by  his  natural  son  Fernando. 
He  was  president  from  1607  to  1628.

the  classical  historians ; but  a very  large  proportion 
of  his  first  part  is  taken  from  Castellanos,  and  much 
of  the  remainder  is  copied  from  the  manuscript  of 
Vasquez.  The  time  of  his  death  is  not  known,  but 
he  is  believed  to  have  died  in  Spain. 

Simon’s  account  of  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and 
Aguirre  is  contained  in  the  fifty-two  chapters  of  the 
sixth  historical  notice  of  the  first  part  of  his  work  ; 
which  have  now  been  translated  for  the  Hakluyt 
Society,  and  form  the  present  volume.  His  principal 
authority  was  the  manuscript  of  Francisco  Yasquez, 
one  of  the  companions  of  Aguirre,  from  whom  he 
copies  largely,  and  without  any  acknowledgment. 
He  could  not  have  taken  his  narrative  from  a more 
authentic  source ; and  it  is  possible  that  he  may  have 
conversed  with  other  followers  of  Aguirre,  or  with 
men  who  were  engaged  in  the  campaign  which 
ended  in  the  traitor’s  death. 

V.  The  next  author  who  gives  an  account  of 
Aguirre’s  cruise,  is  the  bishop  Piedrahita.  Lucas 
Fernandez  Piedrahita  was  born  at  Bogota,  in  the 
early  part  of  the  seventeenth  century,  the  son  of 
Domingo  Hernandez  de  Soto  Piedrahita,  by  Catalina 
Collantes.  He  studied  in  the  college  of  his  native 
town,  where  he  is  said  to  have  shown  great  talent  for 
poetry,  and,  having  been  ordained,  he  became  trea- 
surer of  the  choir  of  Bogota  in  1654,  and  canon  of 
the  cathedral.  For  several  years  he  was  the  favour- 
ite preacher  in  that  city,  and,  in  1669,  was  appointed 
bishop  of  Santa  Martha,  where  he  lived  in  a simple 
style.  His  clothes  were  often  torn  and  ragged,  so

INTRODUCTION. 


that  his  flesh  could  be  seen,  and  he  practised  all  the 
Christian  virtues.  In  1676  Piedrahita  was  appointed 
bishop  of  Panama,  but,  before  his  departure,  the 
buccaneer,  John  Coxon,  landed  and  sacked  Santa 
Martha,  burnt  the  church,  seized  the  bishop,  and, 
refusing  to  believe  in  his  poverty,  tortured  him  to 
make  him  give  up  his  riches.  The  poor  man  only 
possessed  one  jewel,  a ruby  in  his  episcopal  ring, 
which  he  was  forced  to  surrender,  and  he  was  then 
carried  off,  and  brought  before  Morgan,  on  the 
island  of  Providence.1  That  notorious  buccaneer 
not  only  liberated  him,  but  gave  him  some  episco- 
pal robes  which  he  had  stolen  from  Panama,  years 
before ; and  the  poor  bishop  at  length  reached  his 
new  diocese. 

Piedrahita  passed  the  last  years  of  his  life,  convert- 
ing the  Indians  of  Darien,  and  preaching,  not  only 
in  the  churches,  but  also  in  the  streets  of  Panama. 
He  died  there  in  1688,  aged  seventy,  and  was  buried 
in  the  college  of  the  Jesuits,  now  in  ruins.  The 
materials  for  his  history2  were  the  journal  of  the 
great  conqueror  Gonzalo  Ximenes  de  Quesada;  the 
fourth  part  of  the  Elegias  of  Castellanos  ; and  the 
Noticias  Historiales  of  Simon.  His  style  is  pure  and 
clear,  the  events  are  placed  in  chronological  order, 
his  descriptions  of  localities  are  good,  and  he  affects

allusions  to  classical  authors,  as  much  as  Simon 
neglects  or  despises  them ; but  he  cites  few  autho- 
rities, and  is  inferior,  in  his  method  of  narrating 
events,  to  Simon ; from  whom,  however,  he  copies 
long  passages  almost  literally,  without  any  acknow- 
ledgment, a habit  which  he  may  have  caught  from 
his  predecessor.1 

Piedrahita  does  not  give  any  detailed  account  of 
the  proceedings  of  Aguirre,  until  he  lands  in  Vene- 
zuela ; but  from  that  time  until  the  traitor’s  death, 
the  account  is  almost  as  full  as  that  of  Simon;  and  it 
is  taken,  he  tells  us,  from  Simon,  Castellanos,  and 
that  part  of  the  66  Varones  lllustres  del  Nuevo  Mundo ” 
which  treats  of  Diego  Garcia  de  Paredes.2 

Like  Garcilasso  Inca  de  la  Vega,  the  historian 
Piedrahita  was  descended  from  the  Incas  of  Peru  ; 
and  was  thus  the  second  native  of  South  America 
who  wrote  the  history  of  his  country.  His  ancestor, 
captain  Juan  Munoz  de  Collantes,  who  went  out  to 
the  Indies  as  captain  of  the  guard  to  Garcia  de 
Lerma,  the  governor  of  Santa  Martha  in  1528,  was 
a native  of  the  Alhambra,  in  Granada.  He  after- 
wards lived  in  Peru,  and  married  Dona  Francisca 
Coya,  an  Inca  princess,  by  whom  he  had  a daughter 
named  Mencia  de  Collantes.  Mencia  married  Alonzo 
de  Soto,  and  was  the  great  grandmother  of  the  histo- 
rian Piedrahita.3

INTRODUCTION. 


VI.  The  last  authentic  account  of  the  expedi- 
tion of  Ursua  and  Aguirre,  was  written  by  a native 
of  Caraccas,  and  is  entitled — “ Historia  de  la  con- 
quista  y poblacion  de  la  provincia  de  Venezuela, 
descrito  por  Don  Jose  de  Oviedo  y Banos,  vecino  de 
la  cuidad  de  Santiago  de  Leon  de  Caraccas.  Primera 
Parte.  Madrid.  1723.”  Oviedo  y Banos  confines 
his  narrative  of  Aguirre’s  excesses  to  the  part  which 
relates  to  Venezuela,  and  his  account  is,  for  the 
most  part,  a mere  abstract  of  Simon.1  There  is  no 
copy  of  this  work  in  the  British  Museum,  but  they 
have  one  in  the  library  at  Madrid.  Mr.  Southey 
says  that  he  could  not,  after  diligent  inquiry,  find  a 
copy  of  Oviedo  y Banos ; yet  I see  that  Robertson, 
in  his  History  of  America , quotes  him  once  or  twice. 

None  of  the  other  old  Spanish  historians  give  more 
than  a passing  notice  of  the  extraordinary  expedi- 
tion which  forms  the  subject  of  the  present  volume. 
Garcilasso  de  la  Vega,  who  knew  both  Pedro  de  Ursua 
and  Fernando  de  Guzman  personally,  speaks  highly 
of  the  character  of  Ursua,  but  refers  the  reader  to 
Castellanos  for  further  details.2  Herrera  says  little 
more ; and  Acosta,  whose  sources  of  information 
were  almost  as  good  as  those  of  Simon  (for  he  tells 
us  that  a brother  of  his  company,  being  then  young, 
sailed  with  Ursua,  with  whom  he  was  present  at  all 
his  strange  adventures,  and  at  the  pernicious  acts  of 

a historian.  This  was  Fernando  de  Alva  Yxtlilxochilt,  a descend- 
ant of  the  kings  of  Tezcuco,  on  the  lake  of  Mexico,  who  wrote  a 
history  of  the  Chichemecs.

Aguirre,  from  whom  God  delivered  him  to  place  him 
in  the  company  of  Jesuits),  merely  makes  a passing 
allusion  to  the  subject. 

Sir  Walter  Raleigh,  in  his  account  of  the  attempts 
of  his  Spanish  predecessors  in  the  search  for  El 
Dorado,  makes  several  mistakes  when  he  comes  to 
describe  the  cruise  of  Aguirre  j1  and  these  mistakes 
have  been  greatly  amplified  by  numerous  modern 
authors.  The  chief  offender  is  M.  Gomberville,  the 
French  translator  of  Acuna’s  voyage  down  the  Amazon, 
(Paris  1692)  who  interpolates  an  account  of  Aguirre’s 
voyage,  which  must  have  been  invented  by  himself, 
as  it  contains  as  many  mistakes  as  sentences,  none  of 
which  are  to  be  found  in  Acuna’s  original  narrative, 
where  the  expedition  of  Ursua  and  Aguirre  is  very 
briefly  noticed.2  Condamine,  Mr.  Dalton  in  his  his- 
tory of  British  Guiana,  and  other  modern  writers, 
follow  M.  Gomberville,  who  leads  them  far  away 
from  the  truth.3  The  Ulloas,  who  ought  to  have

the  Hakluyt  Society,  p.  23. 

2 See  Valley  of  the  Amazons , p.  48.  (Hakluyt  Society). 

3 It  would  be  tedious  to  enumerate  all  M.  Gomberville’s  errors, 
but  amongst  them  are  the  following.  He  says  that  Aguirre  and 
Guzman  were  in  love  with  the  lady  Inez,  for  which  he  has  no 
authority  whatever ; that  her  name  was  Agnes  or  Anes ; that 
Aguirre  proclaimed  himself  king ; that  he  descended  the  river 
Coca  into  the  Amazon ; that,  when  he  left  Margarita,  he  went  to 
Cumana ; that  he  desolated  all  the  coast  of  Caraccas ; that  he 
then  went  to  Santa  Martha,  and  put  every  one  to  the  sword ; 
that  he  entered  New  Granada,  and  was  defeated  there ; that  he 
was  taken  a prisoner  to  the  island  of  Trinidad ; that  he  had  a con- 
siderable estate  there ; that  he  was  executed  there,  his  houses  razed, 
and  the  sites  strewn  with  salt.  All  these  are  pure  inventions.

been  better  informed,  give  a more  erroneous  account 
than  even  M.  Gomberville.  They  say  that  Ursua, 
and  the  greater  part  of  his  men,  were  killed  by  the 
Indians,  in  an  ambuscade  : a misfortune  entirely  due 
to  his  own  misconduct ; and  that  thus  the  expedition 
came  to  an  end.1 

Indeed  the  ignorance  of  late  Spanish  writers,  respect- 
ing what  they  themselves  declare  to  be  one  of  the  most 
memorable  events  of  the  time,  is  very  remarkable. 
Velasco,  the  historian  of  Quito,  gives  an  account 
which  he  must  have  picked  up  from  some  vague  tra- 
dition.2 He  says  that  Ursua  founded  a colony,  as  a 
base  for  his  operations,  on  the  banks  of  the  river 
Sapo,  a tributary  of  the  Huallaga,  and  called  it  Sap- 
osoa  : that  he  started  in  1559,  and  was  murdered  while 
navigating  the  Sapo  by  a soldier  named  Aguirre : that 
the  rock  overhanging  the  river  Huallaga  is  still  shown, 
where,  if  the  day  is  clear,  the  inscription  may  be  dis- 
tinctly read,  which  was  cut  by  Aguirre,  after  he  had 
murdered  Ursua  in  the  Sapo  : and  that  Saposoa  was 
abandoned  a few  years  afterwards. 

This  rock,  mentioned  by  V elasco,  is  still  known  as 
66  El  Salto  de  Aguirre  ’ (the  leap  of  Aguirre).  Soon 
after  leaving  Chasuta,  going  down  the  river  Huallaga, 
the  canoe  passes  “ between  cliffs  of  dark  red  rocks, 
where  the  river  deepens  to  forty-two  feet.  On  one 
of  these  rocks,  appearing  like  a gigantic  boulder  of

porphyry,  were  cut  rude  figures  of  saints  and  crosses, 
with  letters  which  are  said  to  express  6 the  leap  of 
the  traitor  Aguirre.’  They  were  too  much  worn  by 
time  and  weather,  to  be  made  out.”1  According  to 
the  Mercurio  Peruano  there  is  a tradition  amongst 
the  Motilones  Indians  that  a vulture  lived  on  this 
rock,  and  preyed  upon  travellers,  until  a man  named 
Aguirre  killed  it ; and  the  explanation  is  supposed 
to  be  that  a man  of  that  name  persuaded  the 
people  to  kill  a pirate,  or,  as  the  author  in  the 
Mercurio  Peruano  supposes,  the  origin  of  the  tradi- 
tion is  to  be  found  in  the  murder  of  Ursua  by 
Aguirre. 

Another  tradition  respecting  the  cruise  of  Aguirre, 
which  is  mentioned  in  the  Mercurio  Peruano , may 
here  be  alluded  to.  The  Mayorunas  Indians  are  a tribe 
living  on  the  right  bank  of  the  mouth  of  the  Ucayali. 
They  have  thick  beards,  and  comparatively  white 
skins;  and  wander  through  the  forests  as  hunters, 
without  going  much  to  the  banks  of  the  rivers. 
They  are  often  called  Barbudos,  are  very  numerous, 
taller  than  most  other  tribes,  at  enmity  with  all  their 
neighbours,  go  perfectly  naked,  are  well  formed,  with 
straight  noses,  and  small  lips,  and,  alone  of  all  the 
tribes  in  this  region,  are  remarkable  for  their  clean- 
liness.2 

The  legend  is,  that  they  are  descended  from  some 
Spanish  soldiers  of  Ursua’s  expedition,  by  native

women  j1  and  it  is  just  possible  that  this  may  be  true, 
for  two  of  the  soldiers  of  Garcia  del  Arze’s  party 
were  lost  in  the  forests,2  and  they  may  have  been 
the  progenitors  of  the  Mayorunas.3 

It  is  very  difficult  to  assign  its  true  place,  in  the 
history  of  geographical  discovery,  to  the  voyage  of 
Aguirre.  It  was  the  opinion  of  most  of  the  ancient 
Spanish  writers  that  the  mutineers  found  their  way 
to  the  Atlantic,  either  by  leaving  the  course  of  the 
Amazon,  ascending  the  Rio  Negro,  and,  by  the 
Cassiquiari  canal,  entering  the  Orinoco,  and  descend- 
ing it  to  its  mouth ; or  by  making  their  way  into 
some  of  the  rivers  of  Guiana.  If  this  was  the  case 
the  discoveries  of  Aguirre  were  both  extensive  and 
important,  but  Baron  Humboldt  and  Mr.  Southey 
saw  no  reason  for  supposing  that  he  ever  left  the 
course  of  the  Amazon.4  The  arguments  for  and 
against  these  two  conflicting  opinions  may  be  stated 
as  follows.  In  favour  of  the  Orinoco  route  there

3 The  Jeberos,  another  tribe  of  the  Amazon,  are  also  descended 
from  Spanish  progenitors,  but  on  the  female  side ; their  ancestors 
having  captured  a number  of  Spanish  women,  in  the  insurrection 
of  1599  : so  that  many  of  them  now  have  beards,  and  fair  com- 
plexions. 

4 Mr.  Southey  originally  intended  to  have  inserted  a chapter  on 
Ursua  and  Aguirre,  in  his  history  of  Brazil,  but  the  subject  being 
only  slightly  connected  with  that  country,  he  laid  his  manuscript 
aside.  He  afterwards  published  it  in  the  Edinburgh  Annual 
Register,  vol.  iii,  part  2,  and  finally  reprinted  it  in  a separate 
volume,  which  was  published  by  Longman  in  1821.  Southey  gives 
a full  abstract  of  Simon’s  narrative,  and  also  quotes  Piedrabita  and

are  several  circumstances  which  may  be  urged,  and 
the  weight  of  authority  is  decidedly  on  that  side  of 
the  question. 

After  the  murder  of  Ursua,  the  traitors  wished  to 
return  to  Peru,  but  at  the  same  time  Aguirre  de- 
sired to  avoid  the  supposed  land  of  Omagua,  which 
he  believed  to  be  lower  down  the  stream  of  the  Am- 
azon ; because  he  feared  that  the  soldiers  would  land 
and  settle  there,  and  thus  thwart  his  design  of  re- 
turning to  Peru,  and  upsetting  the  government  of 
the  viceroy,  whom  he  cordially  hated.  He,  therefore, 
“ made  a turn  out  of  the  way  of  their  direct  route, 
and  navigated  three  days  and  a night  in  a westerly 
direction  ;1  . that  is,  judging  from  the  probable 
position  of  the  adventurers  at  the  time,  he  either 
began  to  ascend  the  stream  of  the  Rio  Negro,  or  one 
of  the  branches  of  the  Japura,  which  communicate 
with  it.  Again,  some  days  afterwards,  he  continues 
to  “ direct  his  course  to  the  left,  by  a branch  of  the 
river,  and  navigates  by  branches  coming  from  the 
west,”2  evidently  continuing  his  course  up  the  Rio 
Negro,  until  he  finds  himself  among  the  Arekainas 
Indians,  a tribe  only  met  with  on  the  upper  waters 
of  the  Rio  Negro,  or  on  the  Putumayu.3  All  these 
statements  seem  to  point  to  the  Rio  Negro  as  the 
course  Aguirre  was  taking,  and,  afterwards,  when 
mention  is  made  of  cakes  of  salt  in  an  Indian  village,4 

Herrera ; but  he  was  unable  to  get  a sight  either  of  Castellanos  or 
Oviedo  y Banos,  and  he  had  never  seen  either  of  the  contempora- 
neous manuscript  accounts  of  Aguirre’s  career.

he  may  be  supposed  to  have  been  approaching  the 
mouths  of  the  Orinoco,  and  that  this  salt  was  ob- 
tained by  the  Indians  from  sea  water,  by  solar 
evaporation.  This  is  all  the  testimony  that  can  be 
obtained  from  Yasquez  or  Simon ; but  Herrera, 
Garcia,  and  Acosta  all  believed  that  the  traitors 
reached  the  sea  by  some  river  opposite  the  island  of 
Trinidad,  and  the  latter  had  his  information  from  a 
man  who  was  actually  in  Aguirre’s  expedition.1 
Acuna,  also,  positively  states  that  Aguirre  did  not 
reach  the  sea  by  the  mouth  of  the  Amazon.2 

But  the  strongest  evidence  in  favour  of  the  Orinoco 
route  is  to  be  found  in  the  way  many  early  writers 
confuse  the  rivers  Orinoco  and  Maranon,  .a  confusion, 
which,  as  I believe,  arose  from  the  conflicting 
accounts  given  by  the  men  of  Orellana’s,  and  those  of 
Aguirre’s  party.  Orellana,  having  descended  the 
main  stream  of  the  Amazon,  gave  a tolerably  correct 
account  of  its  position  ; but  Aguirre’s  men,  having 
reached  the  Atlantic  by  descending  the  Orinoco,  and 
still  continuing  to  call  all  the  water  they  had  seen  by 
the  name  of  Maranon,3  stated  that  its  mouth  (that  is 
the  mouth  of  the  Orinoco)  was  opposite  the  island  of

3 The  fanciful  derivations  of  the  word  Maranon,  given  by  Simon, 
Velasco,  and  Manuel  Rodriguez,  will  be  found  in  a note  at  p.  95 
of  this  volume ; and  Simon  erroneously  asserts  that  the  word 
originated  during  Aguirre’s  cruise.  Mr.  Southey,  however,  in  his 
history  of  Brazil,  has  clearly  shown  that  the  name  was  applied  to 
this  great  river,  fifty-nine  years  before  the  time  of  Aguirre.  He

Trinidad.  This  especially  appears  in  the  account  of 
the  Jesuit  who  was  Acosta’s  informant;  and  the  con- 
fusion  became  so  great  at  last,  that  Friar  Simon 
declared  that  he  could  not  tell  which  river  was  the 
Maranon,  and  that  it  must  remain  an  open  ques- 
tion, until  some  one  writes  about  it  with  better 
information.1 

On  the  other  hand,  the  evidence  in  favour  of 
Aguirre  having  entered  the  sea  by  the  mouth  of  the 
Amazon,  is  chiefly  negative.  The  time  that  is  stated 
to  have  elapsed  between  the  murder  of  Ursua  and 
the  arrival  of  Aguirre’s  vessels  in  the  sea ; as  well  as 
the  length  of  the  voyage  from  the  mouth  of  the  river 
to  the  island  of  Margarita  ; are  more  in  favour  of 
the  Amazon  than  of  the  Orinoco  theory,  and  it  is 
also  stated  that  the  description  of  the  numerous 
islands,  and  of  the  breadth  of  the  mouth  of  the  river, 
is  better  suited  to  the  Amazon.2  Mr.  Southey  thinks 
it  very  improbable  that  Aguirre  ever  left  the  main 
stream  of  the  Amazon  ; and  Baron  Humboldt,  al- 
though at  one  time  he  believed  that  Aguirre  ascended 
the  Japura,  and  reached  the  Atlantic  by  some  river 
of  Guiana ; afterwards  came  to  the  conclusion  that 
there  was  no  evidence  that  the  traitor  did  not  descend 
the  Amazon  to  its  mouth.  Neither  of  these  two 
eminent  writers,  however,  gives  the  grounds  on  which 
he  formed  this  opinion. 

points  out  that  it  is  used  by  Peter  Martyr  in  his  epistles,  and  in 
the  oldest  account  of  Pinzon’s  voyage ; and  he  thinks  it  was  the

INTRODUCTION. 


It  might  be  supposed  that  the  frightful  catastrophe 
in  which  the  expedition  of  Pedro  de  Ursua  was  in- 
volved, would  have  damped  the  ardour  of  the  search- 
ers after  El  Dorado,  at  least  for  a considerable  time ; 
but  this  was  very  far  from  being  the  case.  In  1566, 
only  five  years  afterwards,  one  Martin  de  Proveda 
started  from  Chachapoyas  in  Peru,  close  to  Ursua’s 
point  of  embarkation,  on  a similar  errand.  He  made 
his  way  in  a northerly  direction,  through  dense 
forests,  where  the  great  majority  of  his  men  perished, 
and  eventually  turned  up  at  Bogota : but  there  was 
no  result  from  this  expedition,  except  a rumour  that 
there  were  rich  provinces  to  be  found  still  deeper  in 
the  primeval  forests.  This  rumour,  however,  vague 
as  it  was,  induced  a fellow  townsman  of  Proveda’s,  to 
initiate  another  search  for  El  Dorado. 

This  was  Don  Pedro  Malaver  de  Silva,  a native  of 
Xeres,  who  was  a rich  and  enterprising  man,  married 
in  Chachapoyas.  In  1568,  in  furtherance  of  his 
object,  he  went  to  Spain,  and  received  powers  to 
conquer  Omaguas  and  El  Dorado,  for  a space  of 
three  hundred  leagues,  with  the  government  for  two 
lives.  At  the  same  time  Don  Diego  Fernando  de 
Cerpa  received  a concession  from  the  Boca  del 
Drago,  by  the  mouths  of  the  Orinoco,  to  the  frontier 
of  Silvas  country.  The  two  rival  adventurers  were 
in  Seville  when  news  came  of  the  insurrection  of  the 
Moriscos,  in  the  mountains  of  Granada ; and  Serpa 
was  detained  to  serve  against  them,  while  Silva 
sailed  with  two  ships  in  March  1569,  accompanied 
by  two  brothers,  named  Alonzo  and  Diego  Braba.

Silva  reached  Burburata,  and  marched  thence  to 
Valencia,  in  Venezuela;  but  his  forces  were  dis- 
united, some  went  to  Barquisimeto,  others  to  Tocuyo, 
others  hid  themselves  near  Valencia,  and  the  Barbas 
sailed  for  Carthagena,  having  first  stolen  all  the  wine 
which  their  chief  had  left  at  Burburata.  At  length 
Silva  entered  the  plains,  to  the  south  of  Venezuela, 
with  one  hundred  and  forty  men,  in  July  1569. 

Cerpa  succeeded  in  getting  his  men  away  from  the 
Morisco  wars,  and,  sailing  from  Spain  in  1569,  with 
four  hundred  soldiers,  landed  on  a coast  inhabited  by 
the  warlike  Cumanagotos  Indians,  at  the  mouth  of 
the  Rio  Salado.  Here  he  founded  a city  called  Sant- 
iago de  los  Cavalleros,  where  he  left  the  women  of 
his  party,  intending  to  cross  the  land  to  the  south, 
and  discover  the  Orinoco.  But  the  Indians  attacked 
him  on  the  march,  killed  him  with  their  macanas  or 
clubs,  and  scattered  his  party.  Nearly  all  his  men 
died  of  wounds  or  of  disease,  very  few  escaping  back 
to  Santiago  ; and  the  place  was  abandoned,  the  sur- 
vivors retiring  to  the  island  of  Margarita. 

In  the  meanwhile  Silva  returned  to  Barquicimeto, 
quite  disheartened,  and,  after  visiting  his  home  in 
Peru,  proceeded  to  Spain  with  the  intention  of  try- 
ing some  other  route.  In  1574  he  again  sailed  from 
Cadiz  with  one  hundred  and  sixty  men,  and  landed 
on  the  coast  between  the  mouths  of  the  Orinoco  and 
Amazon,  where  all  his  party  perished,  some  dying 
of  disease,  and  others  being  killed  by  the  Caribs. 
Among  the  sufferers  were  two  little  maidens,  the 
daughters  of  Silva.  Out  of  the  whole  party  only  one

man  escaped,  named  Juan  Martin  de  Albujar,  who 
was  for  ten  years  a prisoner  amongst  the  Indians, 
but,  after  great  dangers  and  hardships,  he  eventually 
reached  the  mouth  of  the  river  Esquinas,  whence 
friendly  Indians  sent  him  in  a canoe  to  Margarita.1 

At  this  time,  the  great  rivers  and  vast  plains, 
between  Guiana  and  the  feet  of  the  cordilleras, 
having  been  traversed  by  numerous  explorers  with- 
out any  result,  the  fable  of  El  Dorado  and  of  the 
“Gran  Laguna  de  Manoa”  began  to  find  a resting 
place  amongst  the  periodically  inundated  plains 
between  the  rivers  Eupununi,  Essequibo,  and  Parima 
or  Branco,  in  Guiana.  The  last  expedition  which 
can  be  said  to  have  achieved  any  important  geo- 
graphical discovery  was  that  of  Don  Antonio  de 
Berreo,  who  had  married  the  daughter  of  Gonzalo 
Ximenes  de  Quesada,  the  great  conqueror  of  Bogota, 
and,  with  her,  had  inherited  the  duty  of  continuing 
the  search  for  El  Dorado.  He  started  from  New 
Granada  in  1582,  and,  following  the  courses  of  the 
rivers  Cassanare  and  Meta,  reached  the  Orinoco ; 
suffering,  like  his  predecessors,  from  disease  and  the 
attacks  of  Indians.  He  descended  the  Orinoco  to 
its  mouth,  and  proceeded  to  the  island  of  Trinidad, 
of  which  he  became  governor.  There  were  numer- 
ous other  insignificant  attempts,  at  about  this  time, 


1 Oviedo  y Banos.  Humboldt  has  suggested  that  the  lying  tale 
of  the  visit  of  Martinez  to  the  great  city  of  Manoa,  which  led  to 
the  expeditions  of  Domingo  de  Vera,  Sir  Walter  Raleigh,  and 
others  of  less  note,  may  have  been  founded  on  the  adventures  of 
Albujar.

made  by  adventurers  from  Venezuela,  Trinidad,  or 
Margarita,  but  they  all  failed,  and  the  expeditions  of 
our  own  Sir  Walter  Paleigh  and  Captain  Key  mis 
may  be  said  to  close  the  long  roll  of  searches  after 
the  fabulous  El  Dorado. 

As  the  search  for  the  philosopher’s  stone  led  to 
many  discoveries  in  chemistry,  so  the  romantic  ex- 
peditions in  quest  of  the  golden  city  of  Manoa,  and 
the  gilded  chief,  conduced  more  than  any  other 
circumstance,  during  the  latter  part  of  the  sixteenth 
century,  to  the  extension  of  geographical  knowledge 
in  South  America.  Many  of  these  expeditions  were 
conducted  with  great  skill  and  perseverance ; others 
are  memorable  for  deeds  of  unequalled  heroism ; but 
none  was  so  extraordinary  as  that  which  Don  Pedro 
de  IJrsua  led  down  from  Peru  into  the  great  valley 
of  the  Amazon,  and  which  ended  in  the  sanguinary 
career  of  the  mad  demon  Lope  de  Aguirre.
